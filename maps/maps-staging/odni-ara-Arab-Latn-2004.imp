  notes:
    - Long/Short Vowels Long and short vowels are not
      distinguished in this system Samir (could be Saamir or
      Samiir in Arabic).
  
    - Double consonants Double consonants represented by the
      Arabic shaddah are shown in most cases (e.g., Hassan,
      Muhammad). Exceptions ’ayn and consonants represented by
      digraphs are not doubled (e.g., al-Qadhafi [not
      alQadhdhafi], Mubashir [not Mubashshir]).
  
    - Hamzah (glottal stop) The hamzah is represented by an
      apostrophe (’). Note that this is the same symbol used to
      represent another consonant, the ’ayn.
  
    - Ta’ marbutah (feminine ending marker) On the construct
      form or when pronounced “t”, it is represented with a roman
      t. In all other cases, it is represented with an h.
  
    - Digraphs No distinction is made between digraphs such as
      sh and single contiguous letters (e.g., s followed by h).
  
    - Definite article “al” (‘the’) Follows Arabic spelling
      rather than pronunciation. That is, sun letter assimilation
      is not shown in the Romanized form (e.g., ’Abd-alRahman,
      not ’Abd-ar-Rahman).
  
    - Diphthongs the second element of the diphthong is
      represented by a y or a w (rather than an i or a u)
      Haytham, Faysal, Tawfiq, Rawdah.
  
    - Hyphens Hyphens (-) are used to connect name elements
      within a name ’Abd- al Rahman, Abu-al-Bashar, Bin-Ladin.
      Exceptions Names that incorporate “Allah” as part of the
      name (e.g., ’Abdallah, Nasrallah), names marked by the
      lineage/family marker “Al” (e.g., Al Thani) are not
      hyphenated.
  
    - The definite article, “al”, within name phrases, is
      Romanized as al and not as ul Nur-al-Din (not Nur-ul-Din).
      It is not capitalized when name-initial.
  
    - Names that incorporate Allah as part of the name retain the
      a of Allah rather than a grammatical marker u ’Abdallah (
      not ’Abdullah).
  
    - Foreign names borrowed or appearing in Arabic are spelled
      according to the standard Western tradition Georges,
      Michel. However, names of non-Arabic origin no longer
      considered foreign by Arabic speakers follow the IC
      conventions Butrus (not Peter).
  
    - Prefix ‫بن‬ (bin ‘son of’) is Romanized Bin unless written
      with an alif, in which case it is Romanized as Ibn. The
      colloquial form Bu (‘father’) should not be standardized as
      Abu. These prefixes are capitalized.
  
    - In general, Romanization follows the Modern Standard
      Arabic (MSA) form rather than local pronunciation
      standards. For example, the letter ‫ج‬ (jim) is represented
      as a j even when pronounced as a “g” (e.g., Egyptian Gamal
      is Romanized as Jamal).
