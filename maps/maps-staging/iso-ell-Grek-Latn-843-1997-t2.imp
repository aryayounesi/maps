  description: |
    Establishes a system for the transliteration and/or transcription
    of Greek characters into Latin characters. This system applies to
    the characters of the Greek script, independent of the period in
    which it is or was used, i.e. scripts from all periods of Classic
    or Modern Greek. Replaces ISO/R 843.
  
  notes:
    - Transliteration of Greek into Latin: Type 2, Clause 3 Table 2
    - Introduced casing to digamma, yot, and lunate sigma. (Casing was late introduction to character sets for those characters)
