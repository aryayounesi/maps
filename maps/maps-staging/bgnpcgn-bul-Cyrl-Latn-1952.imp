  name: ROMANIZATION SYSTEM FOR BULGARIAN BGN/PCGN of 1952
  url: https://libraries.ucsd.edu/bib/fed/USBGN_romanization.pdf
  creation_date: 1945
  confirmation_date: 1952
  description: |
    This system was adopted by the BGN in 1949 and by the PCGN in 1952. It
    reflects the much simplified Bulgarian orthography as officially revised in
    February 1945. The Bulgarian alphabet contains all of the characters present
    in the Russian alphabet with the exception of ё, ы, and э. Notes 1, 2, and 3
    are applicable to sources predating the orthographic reform of 1945.
  
  notes:
    - In modern Bulgarian orthography, the character ъ, does not occcur in word-final position. It should be omitted in romanization when found in word-final position on older sources
    - The obsolete character ѫ, which was replaced by ъ in 1945, should be romanized ŭ
    - The obsolete character ѣ, replaced in 1945 by е or я according to local pronunciation, should be romanized as e or ya, accordingly, if the pronunciation is known; otherwise, as ye
    - The character sequence тс may be romanized t·s in order to differentiate that romanization from the regularly occurring digraph ts, which represents the character ц
