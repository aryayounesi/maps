    ALA-LC Romanization table for Bengali
  
  notes:
  
    - Only the vowel forms that appear at the beginning of a syllable are
      listed; the forms used for vowels following a consonant can be found in
      grammars; no distinction between the two is made in transliteration.
  
    - |
      The vowel a is implicit after all consonants and consonant clusters
      and is supplied in transliteration, with the following exceptions:
  
      a) when another vowel is indicated by its appropriate sign; and
      b) when the absence of any vowel is indicated by the subscript symbol ( ্ )
        called hasanta or birāma.
  
    - ব is used both as a labial and as a semivowel. When it occurs as the
      second or subsequent consonant of a consonant cluster, it is
      transliterated va. When ব is doubled, it is transliterated bba.
  
    - Candrabindu before guttural, palatal, cerebral, and dental occlusives
      is transliterated n̐. Before labials, sibilants, semivowels, the
      aspirate, vowels, and in final position it is transliterated m̐.
  
    - When doubled, abagraha is transliterated by two apostrophes ( ’’ ).
