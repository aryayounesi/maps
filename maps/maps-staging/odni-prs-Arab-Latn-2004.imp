  notes:
    - This standard is intended only for those Afghan names
      that have a common bond or similarity with Iranian or
      Arabic names.  They should not, for example, be used for
      Pashto names, for which a separate standard should be used.
    - Long/short vowels:- There is no distinction made in Roman
      between long and short a:-  E.g., Farhad (first a is short,
      second is long).
    - Double consonants:-  Double consonants represented by the
      tashdid are shown by doubling the Roman letter:-  Mohammad.
      Exceptions:-  Consonants represented by Roman digraphs (
      e.g., sh, ch) are not doubled:-  Mobasher [not:-  Mobashsher]
      .  Double letters are only used for tashdid (thus, Hosein [
      not Hossein]) or to reflect the ‘sun letter’ assimilation (
      see below).
    - Hamzeh:-  The hamzeh is represented name-internally by an
      apostrophe, as is the ain.  Name-initially, however,
      neither hamzeh nor ain are indicated in transliteration (
      e.g., Abdorrahman, not 'Abdorrahman).
    - Digraphs:-  No distinction is drawn in Roman between
      digraphs such as sh and single contiguous letters (e.g., s
      followed by h).
    - Arabic definite article "al" ('the'):-  Common in many
      names borrowed from Arabic, the transliteration should show
      the 'sun letter' assimilation rather than the “l” for the
      lam.  That  is:-  Abdorrahman.  Note also that the "Abdol +
      attribute of Allah" names are written as one unanalyzed
      word, as are other names that contain the definite
      article:-  Shamsoddin (not Shams al-Din), Nezamoddin, etc.
    - Diphthongs:-  Diphthongs are written ei and ow
      respectively:-  Hosein; Khosrow.
    - Yeh maqsura (final yeh pronounced as “a”):-  should be
      written as “a” as in “Musa”.

    - Special Rules

    - Hyphens:-  A hyphen is used to indicate the ezafeh
      construction:-  Arshad-e Ameri
    - Borrowed names that incorporate the name of God (Allah)
      are transliterated as one word, with the letter "o":-  E.g.,
      Abdollah, Ayatollah, Azizollah.
    - Foreign names borrowed or appearing in Dari are spelled
      according to the standard Western tradition (even if there
      is an Arabic or Dari version of the same name):-  Joseph,
      Michael.
    - Common suffixes, such as gol, pur, mand, yar, zadeh,
      etc., as well as nesbeh (‘relationship’ (to place of birth,
      etc.)) names derived with these suffixes  (e.g., abadi) are
      written as part of the name:-

      gol		Parigol, Ziagol
      pur		Shahpur, Mehrpur
      mand		Gulahmand
      yar		Aminyar
      zadeh		Ismailzadeh, Karimzadeh

      abadi		Kamalabadi
