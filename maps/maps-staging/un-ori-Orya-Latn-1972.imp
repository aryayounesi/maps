  name: REPORT ON THE CURRENT STATUS OF UNITED NATIONS ROMANIZATION SYSTEMS FOR GEOGRAPHICAL NAMES -- Oriya Romanization, 1972

  description: |
    The United Nations recommended system was approved in 1972 (II/11), based on a report
    prepared by D. N. Sharma. The note on the system was published in volume II of the
    conference reports.

    There is no evidence of the use of the system either in India or in international cartographic
    products.

    Oriya uses an alphasyllabic script whereby each character represents a syllable rather than one sound.
    Vowels and diphthongs are marked in two ways: as independent characters (used syllable-initially) and in an
    abbreviated form, to denote vowels after consonants. The romanization table is unambiguous. The system is mostly
    reversible but there may exist some ambiguities in the romanization of vowels (independent vs. abbreviated characters)
    and consonants (combinations with subscript consonants vs. character sequences).

  notes:
    - Combinations with r as the first component are written with a special superscript symbol, e.g. ର୍କ rka.
