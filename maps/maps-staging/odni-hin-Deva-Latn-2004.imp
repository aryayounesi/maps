    IC STANDARDS FOR TRANSLITERATION OF HINDI AND URDU PERSONAL NAMES
  
  notes:
    - |
      Long/Short Vowels: Long and short vowels are not distinguished in the system:
      The borrowed Arabic name Samir could represent two distinct names, one with a
      long /a/ (Saamir) and one with a long /i/ (Samiir). One solution would be to use
      /ee/ to stand for the long /i/, as is often done (Sameer). The IC Standard will not
      distinguish between these.
    - |
      No distinction is made between: retroflex and non-retroflex consonants; and
      nasalized vowels and vowels followed by /n/.
    - |
      A distinction is drawn between Urdu letters qaf and kaf (and correspondingly,
      Hindi qa and ka).
    - |
      A distinction is drawn between aspirated (e.g., /d/) and nonaspirated consonants
      (e.g., /dh/), with the exception of ch/chh, both represented by /ch/.
    - |
      Digraphs: No distinction is made between digraphs such as /sh/ and single
      contiguous letters such as /s/ followed by /h/.
    - |
      Hyphens: Hyphens (-) are NOT used to connect name elements within a name:
      Abdur Rahman. The single exception to this is the izafat (i.e., linking vowel in
      noun-link-modifier construction of Persian origin), which does show a hypen
      before the /e/ and a following space: Koh-e Nur (‘mountain of light’), “Jaish-e
      xx” (‘Army of xx’ construction).
    - |
      Names incorporating “din” are written as one unit: Azermuddin, Badruddin,
      Faizuddin, Salahuddin.
    - |
      Names that incorporate Allah as part of the name show the Arabic grammatical
      marker /u/ rather than the /a/ of Allah: Abdullah (not Abdallah).
    - |
      Inherent short vowel /a/ in Devanagari is represented with an /a/ in Roman. Final
      consonants are assumed not to have a short /a/ (e.g., masc. name Ram Lal, not
      Rama Lala).
    - |
      As a general rule, Devanagari va is transcribed as a /v/: Vijay, Vishal, etc.
      Exception: /sw/ combination: Saraswati, Krishnaswami. Urdu wau, however, is
      transcribed as /w/: Wasim, Walid.

# concerned about any regular expressions found in this file and about
# advanced expressions in parallel {} parts, and also about the order
