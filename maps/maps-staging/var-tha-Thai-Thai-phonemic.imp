  description:
    This map performs two tasks.
  
    First the text is segmented using a dictionary.
    Then Thai texts will be sent to an external module to get converted into
    Phonemic Thai.
  
    Note that the accuracy for vowel length distinction and certain tonal alternation
    is low.

# This map has been partially converted by the bin/maps_v1_to_v2 script
# The section below requires human attention. Remember to remove this
# comment and move the converted map to 'maps/' directory. Please also
# take note that the maps-staging directory will be cleaned up whenever
# you run the bin/maps_v1_to_v2 script. You should particularly be
# concerned about any regular expressions found in this file and about
# advanced expressions in parallel {} parts, and also about the order
# of particular parts of the stage.
