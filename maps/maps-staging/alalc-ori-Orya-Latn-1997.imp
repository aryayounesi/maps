  notes:
    - |
      Only the vowel forms that appear at the beginning of a syllable are listed; the forms used for vowels following a
      consonant can be found in grammars; no distinction between the two is made in transliteration.
    - |
      The vowel a is implicit after all consonants and consonant clusters and is supplied in
      transliteration, with the following exceptions:
      a) when another vowel is indicated by its appropriate sign; and
      b) when the absence of any vowel is indicated by the subscript sign ( ୍ ) called hasanta.
    - |
      ବ is used both as a labial and as a semivowel. When it occurs as the second consonant of a
      consonant cluster, it is transliterated va. When ବ is doubled, it is transliterated bba.
    - |
      Exception: Anusvāra is transliterated by:
        a) ṅ before gutturals,
        b) ñ before palatals,
        c) ṇ before cerebrals,
        d) n before dentals, and
        e) m before labials.
    - |
      Candrabindu before guttural, palatal, cerebral, and dental occlusives is transliterated n̐.
      Before labials, sibilants, semivowels, the aspirate, vowels, and in final position it is
      transliterated m̐.
    - When doubled, abagraha is transliterated by two apostrophes ( ’’ ).
