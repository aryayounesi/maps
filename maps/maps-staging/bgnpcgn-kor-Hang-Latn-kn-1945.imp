  notes: "
  
    1. At the end of a syllable, the character ᄋ should be romanized ng,
       as in the following example:
  
       평양 → P’yŏngyang
  
       At the beginning of a syllable, the character ᄋ is silent and
       should not be romanized. An example follows:
  
       용화 → Yonghwa
  
    2. Syllable boundaries within words are not reflected in romanization.
       In the different types of syllables shown in the table below, C
       represents any consonant character, V represents any vowel character
       and / represents a syllable boundary.
  
         Han’gŭl              개성      남포      안양
         Syllable boundaries  CV/CVC   CVC/CV   VC/VC
         Romanization         Kaesŏng  Namp’o   Anyang
  
    3. Euphonic changes occurring within a word, including between the
       specific and generic of a geographical name, should be reflected in
       romanization. Generic terms are usually seen separated from the name
       by a hyphen and with a lower case initial letter rather than as a
       separate word:
  
         영진리 → Yŏngjil-li
         덕흥리 → Tŏkhŭng-ni
         압록강 → Amnok-kang
         대동강 → Taedong-gang
  
    4. As a result of 조선말규범집 (‘Standard Korean Language’ guidelines
       published in North Korea in 1966), unlike the Korean spoken in the
       Republic of Korea, the language spoken in the Democratic People’s
       Republic of Korea maintains and pronounces the word-initial ᆯ (‘r’).
       The use of the word-initial ᄅ ('r') can be seen in official news
       reports as well as native mapping. Since such examples exist, the
       word initial ᄅ ('r') is reflected as an option in the tables given above.
  
    5. The Romanization column shows only lowercase forms but, when romanizing,
       uppercase and lowercase Roman letters as appropriate should be used.
