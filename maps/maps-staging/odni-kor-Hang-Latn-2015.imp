  notes: |
    1.  Name order shall be Family Name Given name, with the family name separated
        from the given name by one space, and the first and second syllable of a two-
        syllable given name connected by a hyphen. The initial letter of the family name
        and the initial letter of the first syllable of the given name are capitalized; the
        second syllable of the given name is in lower case: Kim Yo’ng-su.
  
    2.  In the case of a full name with only two syllables, the initial letters of both
        syllables are capitalized and the two names are separated by a space: Ho’ Tam.
  
        In the case of family names consisting of a combination of two syllables, the
        syllables are written together (i.e., without a space): So’nu Hak-wo’n.
  
    3.  The family surname 이 will be rendered "Yi" in the IC Standard spelling, but in
        accordance with personal preference or official usage in the Factbook and Chiefs
        of State directory.
  
    4.  In order to facilitate the use of the IC Standard, a reference guide containing a list
        of syllables used in Korean personal names along with their IC Standard
        equivalents follows.
