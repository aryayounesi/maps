    ALA-LC Romanization table for Prakrit
  
  notes:
  
    - Only the vowel forms that appear at the beginning of a syllable are listed; the forms used for
      vowels following a consonant can be found in grammars; no distinction between the two is
      made in transliteration.
  
    - |
      The vowel a is implicit after all consonants and consonant clusters and is supplied in
      transliteration, with the following exceptions:
  
      a) when another vowel is indicated by its appropriate sign; and
      b) when the absence of any vowel is indicated by the subscript sign ( ् ) called halanta or
         virāma.
  
    - |
      Exception: Anusvāra is transliterated by:
  
      a) ṅ before gutturals,
      b) ñ before palatals,
      c) ṇ before cerebrals,
      d) n before dentals, and
      e) m before labials.
      In other circumstances it is transliterated by a tilde (~) over the vowel.
  
    - When doubled, avagraha is transliterated by two apostrophes ( ’’ ).
