  description: |
    This map loads two external maps to convert Thai text first into phonemic Thai,
    and then into IPA transcription.

    The IPA transcription will then be handled by this map, and converted into
    Royal Thai General System of Transcription (1999)

    The first two parts are done via two external maps.

  notes: |
    The conversion from Thai to Phonemic Thai is still work-in-progress.
