  description: |
    This system is the Intelligence Community standard for the transliteration of Uyghur person names
    that will be applied to all final written reports and products for IC consumers. It is not
    intended to eliminate variations of a name that can contribute forensic information. Rather, it is
    to provide an IC standard Romanized (English) transliteration from Uyghur that can then be linked
    to forensic information in ways that will help identify the referent of the name.

    In cases where an individual’s name has already been transliterated in a variant spelling, the IC
    Standard spelling should appear first, followed by the variant spelling(s) in parentheses at the
    first usage. In addition, if the original Cyrillic-script or Arabic-script spelling is known, that
    spelling should also appear in parentheses following the name, if possible, following best
    practices of the issuing organization and taking into consideration information system capabilities.
    For example: Zordun Sabir (also seen as Zordun Sabeer, Зордун Сабир ,زوردون سابیر). This convention
    is designed to ensure that vital forensic information is not lost.

    For names of persons who are known to not be part of the Uyghur-speaking community, use the relevant
    IC transliteration standard for names from that language (e.g., Yitzhak). A translator’s note may be
    used to clarify the known origin of the person. Spell names of individuals from languages that are
    written in Roman letters as they are spelled in those languages (e.g., George Clooney, Jorge Garcia,
    Georges Pompidou).

    In the case of active senior government officials in the on-line CIA World Factbook and the on-line
    directory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments, the spellings given in
    these on-line reference works should be used in place of the IC Standard. For any individual who has
    at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of State directory but who no longer appears in
    those resources (i.e. is no longer a government official), the IC Standard spelling should appear
    first, with the spelling, if known, as it previously appeared in those resources listed within
    parentheses at the first usage.

    The primary goal is to produce a consistent Romanized transcription of names that is specifically
    readable to the English-speaking non-specialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard
    (English) Roman alphabet. Some ambiguities in the Romanized form will occur without the use of
    diacritics. However, within the context of a report, where additional information about the
    individual is provided, the referent will be clearly identified. This system will be used in
    conjunction with on-line tools, name dictionaries, and lists containing conventional spellings of
    names of well-known individuals.

  notes:
    - Transliterate double digraphs as a single digraph, i.e. шш -> sh, not shsh
    - In the Roman, no distinction is made between digraphs such as 'sh' and single contiguous letters,
      (e.g. 's' followed by 'h').
    - The Cyrillic ъ and ь are not transliterated, but instead are left out of the transliteration.
