  description: |
    The following is the BGN/PCGN-approved romanization
    system for deriving standard spellings of Baluchi
    geographic names. The romanization system is based on
    the Hunterian system of romanization, which has been
    used by the Surveys of India and Pakistan for
    romanizing Baluchi geographic names for more than one
    hundred years. The romanization system is compatible
    with all dialects of Baluchi, including Eastern
    Baluchi, Western Baluchi, and Southern Baluchi.

    The BGN/PCGN system laid out below includes diacritical
    marks in order that the original script can be derived
    from the romanized form (i.e. it is reversible). For
    desk users requiring a diacritic-free form, these
    diacritics can simply be removed. In almost every case
    the same basic Roman-script characters are kept as are
    used in the Hunterian system. The BGN/PCGN forms have
    further been designed to harmonize with the BGN/PCGN
    Urdu romanization system. In rigorous romanization
    (i.e. including diacritics), retroflexion is marked by
    a sub-dot, and aspiration is marked by an apostrophe,
    where confusion with fricative digraphs could arise.
    For letters used only in Arabic loan words, the
    rigorous forms have further been designed to harmonize
    with the BGN/PCGN Persian romanization system.

  notes:
    - Occasionally, sequences of /z/ or /s/ plus /h/ may be
      encountered, i.e. z·h, s·h. These may be romanized with the
      Unicode 'center dot' (U+00B7) separating the two letters,
      to distinguish them from the digraphs /zh/ and /sh/.

    - The character ة is found very rarely in Baluchi, principally in certain Arabic religious terms, e.g. zakāt
      ('alms'). It should be romanized t.

    - When the letters ال are found, representing the Arabic
      definite article, the ل is assimilated to a following 'sun letter' ,د ,ث ,ت
      ل ,ظ ,ط , ض , ,ص ,ش ,س , ,ر ,ذ or ن and is romanized t, , d, , r, z, s, sh, ş, ẕ ţ z , l, n accordingly.

    - In romanization, the suffixes ءَ (-ā, singular definite)
      and ءِ (-ay, possessive) are connected to the previous word
      by a hyphen, though they are usually written separately.

    - The word for 'and', written as و or ءُ, should be
      romanized as –u-, linked by hyphens to the two words it
      connects; e.g.,
      ہ ٹد و س ٹد → Sind-u-Hind ('The Gangetic Plain').

    - Except as specified in notes 4 and 5, word division in romanization should follow word division in the Baluchi script.

    - Note that the short vowels in the Baluchi examples are not pointed.

    - Certain initial, medial and final characters are not
      readily available in a Unicode-encoded font in a standalone form.

    - The Romanization columns show only lowercase forms but,
      when romanizing, uppercase and lowercase Roman letters as
      appropriate should be used.
