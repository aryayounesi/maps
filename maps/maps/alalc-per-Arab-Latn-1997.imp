    (a) the consonant romanized y.
    (b) the long vowel romanized ī.
    (c) the diphthong romanized ay.
    (d) the final long vowel romanized á.

    for ء (hamzah); in this case ى is not represented in romanization.
    See rule 4 below.

  - Rule 4. ء (hamzah)
    (a)When initial, ء is not represented in romanization.
    When medial orfinal, ء is romanized ’ (alif) except as noted
    in (c) and (d) below.
    (c)When used as a mark of izafah, ء is romanized -’i.
    (d)When used to mark the indefinite article i

  - Rule 5. ~(maddah)
    (a) initial آ is romanized ā
    (b) Medial آ, whenit represents the phonetic combination ’ā,
        is so romanized.
    (c) is otherwise not represented in romanization.

  - Rule 6. Tanvin (written ٌ, ٍ , ً , ـًا), which occurs chiefly in Arabic words,
    is romanized un, in, an, and an, respectively.

  - Rule 7. ّ (shaddah or tashdid) is represented by doubling the letter or
    digraph concerned. Note the exceptional case where 4 is written over و and ي
    to represent the combination of long vowel plus consonant.

  - Rule 8.Izafah. When two wordsareassociated in the relation known as
    izGfah,the first (the muzaf) is followed by an additional letter or
    syllable in romanization. This is added according to the following rules
    (a)When the muzaf bears no special mark of izafah, it is followed by-i.
    (b)When the muzaf is marked by the addition ofء, it is followed by-’i.
    (c)Whenthe muzaf is marked by the addition ofcs, it is followed by -yi.
    (d)Izafah is represented in romanization of personal names only when
    expressly indicated in the Persian script.

  - Rule 9.(a) When the affix and the word with which it is connected
    grammatically are written separately in Persian, the two are separated
    in romanization bya single prime (’). See also 12(b) below.
    (b) The Arabic article al is separated by a hyphen, in romanization,
    from the word to which it is prefixed.

  - Rule 10. Compounds. When the elements of a compound (except a
    compound personal name) are written separately in Persian, they are
    separated in romanization by a single prime (’). See also 12(b) below.

  - Rule 11. Capitalization.
    (a) Rules for the capitalization of English are followed, except that
    the Arabic article al is lowercased in all positions.
    (b) Diacritics are used with both capital and lowercaseletters.

  - Rule 12. The single prime (’) is used
    (a) To separate two letters representing two distinct consonantal
    sounds, when the combination might otherwise be read as a digraph.
    (b) To mark theuse ofa letterin its final form whenit occurs in the
    middle of a word. See also rules 9(a) and 10 above.

  - Rule 13. Foreign words in a Persian context, including Arabic words,
    are romanized accordingto the rules for Persian. For short vowels
    not indicated in the script, the Persian vowels nearest the original
    pronunciation of the word are supplied in romanization.

  - Rule 14. Dictionaries.
    In romanizing Persian, the Library of Congress has foundit necessary
    to consult dictionaries as an appendage to the romanizationtables,
    primarily for the purpose of supplying vowels. For Persian, the
    principle dictionary consulted is M. Mu’in. Farhang-i Farsi-i mutavassit
