description: |
  The BGN/PCGN 1958 System for the Persian alphabet was
  adopted by the BGN in 1946 and by the PCGN In 1958. It Is
  used for the romanization of standard geographic names in
  Iran.
  The Persian alphabet is the same as the Arabic alphabet
  except for the addition of four consonant symbols for
  sounds which do not occur in Arabic. Therefore, the same
  conversion values are used for the Persian alphabet as for
  the Arabic alphabet wherever phonetically valid. Where
  letters common to the two alphabets have different
  pronunciation in the two languages, conversion values
  reflecting the Persian pronunciation are provided in the
  Persian system.
  It may be noted that neither the system of pointing nor the
  conversion values for vowels and diphthongs are the same
  for Persian as for Arabic.
  Persian presents the same problems of vowel pointing as
  Arabic in that the short vowel symbols necessary for the
  proper rendering of short vowels, long vowels, and
  diphthongs are almost always omitted from written Persian.
  It follows that, in order to produce transliter- tions in
  terms of standard written Persian, the transliterator must
  be able to identify the words used in names and must know
  their standard written Persian spelling, their proper vowel
  pointing, and how to eliminate pecularities due to
  dialectical variation.
  The notes and special rules explain details of
  transliteration not stated in the tables.

notes:
  - |
    1)The Persian writing system, in its generally used form,
    employs only the symbols found in Table I, and the alef maddeh
    (آ) of Table II. The symbols in column 1 of Table II are
    traditional auxiliary symbols used by Persians only
    sporadically to indicate the exact reading of a given word.
    In the case of i, ū, ey and ow, a choice of symbology
    exists, one system adhering to the Arabic tradition, the
    other being a modification of it. Likewise, there are two
    ways of writing alef maq§ureh. The BGN/PCGN transliteration
    system presupposes forms fully pointed with the Persian
    symbols represented in Table II, though these are omitted
    from the examples given below.

  - 2) Alef ( أ ) occurs with the following uses
    a. Initially, it indicates that the word begins with a vowel or
    diphthong, and the alef itself is not transliterated, e.g.,
    انجيرة Anjīreh, ايواني Eyvānī
    b. Initially with maddeh ( آ ),it indicates ā, e.g., آبادان Ābādān.
    c. Medially and finally. it represents ā, e.g., e.g., آبادان Ābādān,
     توكا Tūkā.
    d.	With hamzeh. See Note 5.


  - 3) Where special considerations are paramount, the sub-dot
    may be used in place of the cedilla

  - 4) The two-letter symbols kh, zh, sh, and gh are convenient
    for use and easily comprehensible. The infrequent sequences
    of kāf, ze, sīn, and gāf followed by he can be unequivocally
    transliterated for bibliographical purposes by the use of a
    slant line (“shilling,” “solidus") to separate true h from
    a preceding k, z, s, or	g; that is,	kh represents khe, but
    k/h stands for kāf followed by he.

  - 5) Hamzeh (ء)	is	not regarded as a letter of the Persian
    alphabet, but as a diacritic mark, and as such is not
    always expressed in actual writing. In fully pointed words,
    however, it appears in several graphic forms, standing
    alone or written in conjunction with alef, vav, or ye (the
    ye in this instance being undotted). All these forms are
    transliterated simply with the apostrophe in the form
    resembling a small raised figure 9 (’)	,e.g., جزء Joz’
    صفراء şafrā’, مأخذ ma’khaz̄, مؤتمن mu’taman, پائين pā’īn Occasionally a word may
    appear pointed according to the strict Arabic tradition so
    as to indicate an initial hamzeh. This initial hamzeh is
    never transliterated, but only the vowel which it carries,
    e.g., •Jfi , whether pointed	or	0	.	is "transliterated
    simply Anjireh.	' Hamzeh is also sometimes written over
    final he or ye to represent the -ye form of the eg&feh, cf.
    Note 8.

  - 6) Alef maddeh is used initially to indicate ā, e.g., آبادان Ābādān
    Noninitially it indicates ’ā in words of Arabic origin,
    and must be so transliterated, e.g., قرآن Qor’ān, مآب ma’āb

  - 7) Tashdid ( ّ) indicates doubling of the consonant over which
    it is written and is represented in transliteration by writing
    the consonant twice, e.g محمّد Mohammad The sequence kasreh ye ye
    is transliterated īy.In names of Arabic origin containing the
    definite article, the vowel of the article is transliterated according
    to its Persian pronunciation and the lam, when followed by a “sun letter”
    (t, s̄, d, z̄, r, s, sh, ẕ, ţ, z̧, ţ, z̧, l, n) is assimilated. The article
    is written in lower case and separate from the preceding and following word,
    e.g., Zeyn od Din, but *£4 . Zeyn ed Dīn. Cf. Special Rule 1.

  - 8) The relational (ezafeh) suffix	is	transliterated -e after final consonants
    (except for silent h). After silent h and after vowels, it is transliterated
    -ye. It is usually not expressed in Persian writing after a consonant
    (kasreh being understood), e.g., كوهِ مَرغٌوب Kuh-e Marghūb. After final alef or vav
    it is written with ye (ي), e.g., بايِ آب	Pa-ye Ab,	جويِ آس Jū-ye Ās.	After	ye (ي)
    and silent he it is written as hamzeh over the letter, e.g., دَهَانهٴ مَمبَر Dahāneh-ye Mambar,
    سَلَيٴ بُذٌرگ Salasi-ye Bozorrg.



  -  1.	In Persian names of Arabic origin, the word division
    used for transliterating Arabic will obtain, except that
    names ending in the word Allah will be written solid and
    the a of Allah will be replaced by o, e.g.,	The Arabic
    definite article when not subject to assimilation will be
    written al in name-initial position but usually, ol
    elsewhere, e.g., Al JJal but 2u ol Faqar. Cf. Note 7 above.

  - 2. In Persian names in general, in sequences of name
    elements pronounced as a single unit, division into
    separate words will be made after Persian letters written
    in the word final form. (But see the Rule immediately
    below.)

  - 3. The word abad which occurs very frequently at
    the end of place names will be written solid with the
    preceding word; e.g., Allahabad, not Allah Abad.

  - 4. Persian derivational endings such as vand and Turkish and other
    endings such as lar, li and lu will be written solid with
    the preceding word, whether so written in Persian script or
    not.

  - 5. The letter he, when used in Turkish fashion for
    word internal e, will be transliterated eh as usual but
    will be written solid with the remainder of the word.

  - 6. Kheplus vdv followed by long vowel or khe plus vdv followed
    by gammeh will be rendered khv although the v is not
    pronounced.
