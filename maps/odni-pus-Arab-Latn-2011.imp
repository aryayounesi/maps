  description: |
    Pashto is a language characterized by its variability. The
    challenges of reaching a universally acceptable
    transliteration standard for personal names are posed both
    by the dialect spread trending roughly from the southwest
    to the northeast parts of its geographic area, and also by
    the competing influences of Dari and Urdu. Given the lack
    of any dominant standard on some points, it has been
    considered necessary to define a certain degree of
    flexibility within this standardization system in order to
    enable it to capture the variability of the language it
    seeks to reflect. A great effort has also been made to
    research and reflect common usage in the Pashto- speaking
    areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to define rules
    which capture these trends to the best extent possible.
    However, a respect for the norms of usage has also been
    balanced with the need for consistency and intelligibility.
    Therefore, there are cases where a less common spelling
    will be the preferred usage under the guidance of this
    system. Lastly, specific names that cannot be incorporated
    gracefully into the rules described below are included with
    case-by-case preferred spellings in a list near the end of
    this document.

  notes:
    # Special rules: Consonants
    - Pashto letter ge (‫ږ‬) The two common renderings for this
      letter are 'zh' and 'g.' 1 The preferred option will be
      'zh' (consistent with the choice of southern 'sh' for ‫)ښ‬.
      However, when referring to communities that consistently
      render the name with a 'g' as opposed to a 'zh,' then 'g'
      will be the preferred option. In these cases, the inclusion
      of a variant spelling with 'zh' is strongly encouraged.

    - Double consonants Double consonants represented by the
      tashdid (shaddah) are shown in most cases regardless of
      whether they are clearly enunciated in speech. Examples
      Muhammad Hassan, Izzatullah. However, consonants
      represented by digraphs are not doubled. Example Mubashir (
      not Mubashshir). Special care should be taken when
      possible to discriminate between doubled and
      non-doubled letters in names that are otherwise
      indistinguishable in their transliterated forms
      Hasan (حسن (vs. Hassan (حسان(

    - Digraphs No distinction is made between digraphs such as 'sh'
      and single contiguous letters such as 's' followed by 'h.'

    # Special rules: Vowels
    - Short vowels zair and pesh The preferred options for the
      short vowels represented by the zair and pesh will be 'i'
      and 'u.' However, in cases where there is a mixed Dari and
      Pashto environment, then the use of 'e' and 'o' is accepted
      in consideration of Dari norms.

    - Long/short vowels Long and short vowels are not
      distinguished in the system (with the exception of
      certain spellings driven by Dari influence as discussed
      above). In this and other systems, the borrowed
      Arabic name Salim could represent two distinct names, one
      with a long /a/ (Saalim - ‫)سالم and one with a
      long /i/ (Saliim - ‫)سلیم‬. This is known as a collision.
      This and many other prevailing standardization
      systems do not distinguish between these types of
      collisions. However, in cases like these, it is
      recommended that a vigorous effort be made to include
      variant spellings in order to eliminate ambiguity
      as to which name is intended, as in the following examples
      Hamid (var. Hameed) – ‫حمید‬
      Hamid (var. Hamed) – ‫حامد‬

    - Izafat The linking vowel of Persian origin known as the
      izafat will be written with a hyphen and then 'e'
      and then a following space. Example Koh-e Nur ("mountain
      of light"). There will be no special
      accommodation for when the initial word ends in a vowel.

    # Special rules: Arabic
    - The Arabic article al ( ‫ال‬ ) The Arabic article will be
      written with a lowercase 'a' and followed by a hyphen, with
      the obvious exception that an uppercase 'a' should be used
      where required by English orthographic conventions, e.g.,
      at the beginning of a sentence. Example Karim al-Afghani

    - Genitive constructions Multi-part Arabic names that follow
      the Arabic genitive construction will be written with a
      lowercase ul joined to the last part of the name by a
      hyphen. Arabic sun letter assimilation generally will not
      be shown.
    # Genitive construction exceptions
    - In deference to widespread usage, the name Abd will be
      combined with the genitive article ul,
      and the rest of the name will be written separately (
      specifically, one of the ninety-nine
      "names of God"). Examples Abdul Haq, Abdul Rahman
    - Names incorporating "--ullah" will be written as a single
      unit. Examples Abdullah, Rahmatullah
    - Names incorporating "--din" will be written as a single
      unit with sun letter assimilation
      shown, causing ul to change to ud. This type of name is the
      only case in which sun letter assimilation will be shown.
      Examples Jamaluddin, Shamsuddin
    - Note, no effort will be made to force names into the
      genitive construction if they are not
      linked by the article. For example, both names Fazl ul-
      Rahman and Fazl Rahman would be
      acceptable, depending on whether the article was included
      in the individual's name.

    - Consonant clusters Traditional Arabic names ending in a
      final consonant cluster will be spelled with the
      consonant cluster intact. Although most native Pashto
      speakers will break up the cluster in conversational
      speech, general usage in the written transliteration of
      names still favors the preservation of the consonant
      cluster in print.
      This type of name should not be confused with Arabic names whose orthography includes a zabar (short
      'a' vowel) prior to the final consonant. -- NOT DONE

    # Special rules: Multiple-part Pashto names
    - TODO

    # Special rules: Glides versus consonants
    - The unwritten phonetic "glides," also known as semi-
      consonants (sounding similar to /y/ and /w/), will
      generally not be shown between two vowels.
      Examples Rauf, Said (سعيد)

    - Care should be taken to distinguish the above rule from
      cases in which wao or ya are a written part of the name and
      function as true consonants, including cases where they are
      doubled. Examples Fayiz ( ‫فایز‬ ), Fayyaz ( ‫فیّاض‬ )

    - A common form where ya will be shown in its role as a
      consonant is with the Arabic nisba (suffix showing origin,
      relation, etc.) appended to names that end in a vowel.
      Examples Ziayi, Shafiyi, Mirzayi, Paktiayi

    # Specific rules: Exceptions
    - TODO
      In spite of best intentions, the unbending application of
      rules in any transliteration system is likely to produce
      some forms that fly in the face of accepted use. Therefore,
      the following names will be spelled as follows, in spite of
      minor variance with the rules described above.
      Aurangzeb (not Awrangzeb)
      Eid (not Id)
      Faizad (not Faizzad)
      Javed (not Jawed) 2
      Parvez (not Parwez)
      Qureshi (not Quraishi)
      Saad (not Sad)
      Sherpao (not Sherpaw)

    - The following names do not constitute exceptions to the
      rules of this standard, but they are names that pose
      significant challenges to standardization and are therefore
      listed here to ensure consensus
      Bahadur (not Bahadar, Bahader)
      Feroz (not Firoz, Fairuz, etc.)
      Firdaws (not Firdos)
      Husain (not Hussain)
      Isfandyar (not Asfandyar)
      Ismail (not Ismael)
      Khushhal (not Khushal)
      Niamat (not Nimat)
      Numan (not Nauman)
      Raza (not Reza)
      Sherzad (not Shirzad)
      Tor Jan (not Tur Jan)
      Uwais (not Awais)

    # Special rules: Titles
    - We treat the spelling of commonly used titles differently
      from the handling of names, given that titles are subject
      to norms of English as they are accepted into the English
      language. Though not specifically covered by the scope of
      this transliteration standard, the following spellings are
      recommended for the sake of consistency
      Akhund
      Amir
      Commander (not Commandan)
      Hafiz
      Haji
      Mawlana
      Mawlawi
      Mullah
      Qari
      Qazi
      Sahib
      Sheikh
      Syed ( ‫سیّد‬ )
      Ustad
