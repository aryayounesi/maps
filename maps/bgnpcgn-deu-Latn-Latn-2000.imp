  notes:
    - |
      The special letter β, known as eszett, [Unicode: 03B2] is a standard letter of the German alphabet and occurs
      only in word-medial and word-final positions. It is a lowercase letter only, and when a word and/or a name is
      written entirely in uppercase letters, it is always rendered as SS. As a result of the orthographic reform of
      German, implemented in August 1998, the β is now rendered ss if it follows a short vowel, but it is still used
      if it follows a long vowel or a diphthong. In those instances where β cannot be reproduced, the digraph ss
      may be substituted for it. For alphabetization and sorting purposes, β should be treated as ss.

      In those instances when the vowel letters ä [Unicode: 00E4], ö [Unicode: 00F6], and ü [Unicode: 00FC]
      cannot be reproduced, the alternate spellings ae, oe, and ue may be substituted.
