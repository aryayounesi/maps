    The tabulation below is applicable to the Kurdish language as a
    whole. It is based for the most part on the Hawar Roman alphabet used
    in the Library of Congress Standard Kurdish Orthography Table, but it
    also incorporates certain non-Hawar elements found in A Kurdish-English
    Dictionary (Taufiq Wahby & C J Edmonds, OUP, 1966). The tabulation
    covers both major varieties of the Kurdish language: Kurmanji and
    Sorani. Kurmanji is spoken principally in Turkey and in Iraq north of
    the Great Zab River (Dahūk/Dihok Governorate). It is generally written
    in Roman script, and usually employs the Roman orthography. Sorani is
    spoken principally in Iraq south of the Great Zab river (Arbīl/Hewlêr
    and As Sulaymānīyah/Slêmanî governorates). It is generally written in
    Perso-Arabic script, and usually employs the Perso-Arabic script
    orthography.

    Kurdish forms of geographical names in Turkey will usually be found
    in Roman script, and so no romanization process will be required. The
    digraph options for consonant letters '\u0686', '\u0634', and '\u063A'
    will not be encountered for such names. In Iraq, Syria, and Iran,
    Kurdish will usually be encountered in Perso-Arabic script, in which
    case it should be romanized into the corresponding Roman script form.
    Kurdish geographical names for places and features outside Turkey,
    found in Roman script form, should, where necessary and if possible, be
    tailored to fit the orthography of the Romanization shown below and
    should employ the digraph options for consonant letters '\u0686',
    '\u0634', and '\u063A'.

  notes:

    - In pure Kurdish words hamza is borne by yā’ ( ئ ) and occurs only
      before initial vowels; it is not romanized. Medial and final hamza in
      Arabic borrowings are romanized by ’ (apostrophe – Unicode encoding
      2019).

    - The letters ث ذ ص ض ط ظ do not occur in pure Kurdish words. In Arabic
      borrowings some writers retain these letters, others substitute س ز س ز
      ت ز respectively. Only the letters ط ض and ص are catered for in the
      Library of Congress tabulation, as reflected in lines 16-18 of the
      above Consonant table. Words of obvious Arabic origin occurring in a
      Kurdish toponymic environment will be treated as Kurdish rather than
      Arabic, as will words of other non-Kurdish origins.

    - The digraph options appearing in rows 6, 15 and 20 of the consonants
      table should be used for Kurdish geographical names in Iraq, Iran, and
      Syria. The single character options should be used for Kurdish
      geographical names in Turkey.

    - ڨ is used to represent v in foreign words. Some southern Kurdish
      writers use it to represent the v in borrowings from northern Kurdish
      dialects. و is pronounced as a v in the north and as a w elsewhere.

    - Hā’ can be used as a vowel or a consonant. The initial (ه) and medial
      (forms are used for the consonant h, Consonant table, row 31, while the
      final (ه) and independent (forms are used to represent the vowel e,
      Vowel table, row 1. Therefore, when used as a consonant, the final and
      independent forms of hā’ will be seen as ‘ه’ instead of ‘and ‘ه’,
      respectively. For example, مهه meh, (“month”). When used as ‘e’, the
      hā’ behaves like the letters alif (ا) , wāw, dāl (د) , and rā (ر) , in
      that it never joins to the following letter (i.e., it has no medial
      form). Consequently, the following letter will display the initial
      form, e.g. هەولێر Hewlêr (unless there is only one following letter, in
      which case it will be written in the independent form, e.g. ماوەت
      Mawet). As with other vowels (see special rules 2 and 3), initial e is
      preceded by the kursî hamza, yielding initial ئه , e.g. ئهني enî
      “forehead”.

    - In pure Kurdish words, the vowel ى is always long î, e.g. كانى ماسێ
      Kanî Masê. When it represents îzafe, it is also romanized î and joined
      by means of a hyphen to its preceding word e.g. پارێزگاى دهۆك Parêzga-î
      Dihok.

      An inventory of letter-diacritic combinations, used in addition to
      the unmodified letters of the basic Roman script in the Romanization of
      Kurdish, with their Unicode encoding, is:

        '‘': '\u2018' , '’': '2019'
        'Ç': '00C7' , 'ç': '00E7'
        'Ḍ': '1E0C' , 'ḍ': '1E0D'
        'Ê': '00CA' , 'ê': '00EA'

        # There is no single Unicode encoding for these letter-diacritic combinations.
        'Ḧ': '0048+0308' , 'ḧ': '0068+0308'
        'Î': '00CE' , 'î': '00EE'
        'Ł': '0141' , 'ł': '0142'
        'Ö': '00D6' , 'ö': '00F6'
        'Ṟ': '1E5E' , 'ṟ': '1E5F'
        'Ş': '015E' , 'ş': '015F'
        'Ṣ': '1E62' , 'ṣ': '1E63'
        'Ṭ': '1E6C' , 'ṭ': '1E6D'
        'Û': '00DB' , 'û': '00FB'
        'Ü': '00DC' , 'ü': '00FC'
        'Ẍ': '1E8C' , 'ẍ': '1E8D'

    - The Romanization column shows only lowercase forms but, when
      romanizing, uppercase and lowercase Roman letters as appropriate should
      be used.

    # Special Rules
    - The conjunction و (and) should be rendered u if the
      preceding word ends in a consonant, and w if the preceding
      word ends in a vowel. It should be separated by spaces from
      the preceding and following words.

    - In the Perso-Arabic orthography for Kurdish, all vowels are
      written, with the exception of the short i, which is
      expressed with a kasrah under the preceding consonant (ِ).
      In Perso-Arabic script, the kasrah will rarely be written (
      e.g., كرن kirin “to do”). Like all Kurdish vowels, the
      short i will be preceded by a kursî hamza )ئ )if it appears
      at the beginning of a word (see 3 below; see row 4 of vowel
      table).

    - In the Perso-Arabic orthography for Kurdish, when a vowel
      comes at the beginning of a word, or when a vowel directly
      follows another vowel, a kursî hamza )ئ )precedes it (e.g.,
      ئاگر agir “fire”).

    - A Kurdish word will never start with alif )ا .)A Kurdish
      word may begin with a yā’ (ي) or wāw )و ,)but only when
      they are used as a consonant, when they will be romanized
      as y and w, respectively.

    - When preceded by a consonant, yā’ (ي )and wāw )و )should be
      romanized î and u, respectively. When preceded by a vowel (
      including short i, which is not written), yā’ (ي )and wāw (
      و )should be romanized y and w, respectively.

    - The Arabic sign shaddah ( ّ ) denoting a doubled consonant
      is not used in Kurdish; doubled consonants, which are rare,
      are written twice e.g. موحەممەد Muḧemmed; ننا موسه Musanna.
      Shaddah might be used in Arabic borrowings but, as in
      unpointed Arabic, would generally be omitted.

    - Particles such as له le (= at, in, on) and به be (= to,
      for, by, with) should be written separately from their
      following word, e.g. كوردستانێ له Le Kurdistanê “in
      Kurdistan”

    - Occasionally the character sequences چه ,سه and گه occur.
      They may be romanized c·h, s·h, and g·h in order to
      differentiate those romanizations from the digraphs ch, sh,
      and gh.
