  description: |
    This romanization system corresponds to that devised in 2002 by the
    State Department of Geodesy and Cartography of Georgia and the
    Institute of Linguistics of the Georgian Academy of Sciences, and
    approved by Presidential Decree 109 of 24 February 2011. It represents
    the Mkhedruli alphabet, as presently used in Georgia. This system was
    adopted by BGN and PCGN in 2009, superseding the BGN/PCGN system of
    1981.

  notes:
    - This system denotes ejective (glottalised) consonants by means of
      an apostrophe. The BGN/PCGN 1981 system instead used the apostrophe to
      denote aspirated consonants (letters 8, 21, 22, 26 & 27).
    - The Romanization columns show only lowercase forms but, when
      romanizing, uppercase and lowercase Roman letters as appropriate should
      be used.
