  description: |
    This system reflects the Bulgarian national system officially adopted
    by state decree in March 2009. It was adopted by BGN and PCGN in 2013,
    replacing the BGN/PCGN system of 1952.

  notes:
    - When in final position, “ия” is romanized as “ia” (e.g., София = Sofia; София-Град= Sofia-Grad).
    - An exception to the romanization system is allowed for the name of the state. Thus, България is romanized as Bulgaria.
    - The Romanization column shows only lowercase forms but, when romanizing, uppercase and lowercase Roman letters as appropriate should be used.
