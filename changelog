## outline
the original map for Persian have some errors in it, some crucial and a few in notes; I have append them based on official, wide accepted rules; by **official** and **wide accepted** I mean they are rules that most scholars hold them as correct but still one could find junior academic individual who think differently. besides, there is a couple of controversies on Persian alphabet, style of writing and spelling, such as for whether counting specific letters as independent letters; a few of them are occuring in Arabic, as well, to name one, the problem with Hamza ء . furthermore, one another root for controversies or different styles is movements who trying to distinguish themself from Arabic origin of letters and words; thinking in that way, a minority write persian in *wrong* way deliberately and on purpose, for example in social media it could be seen that, mostly, youngs write "حرص" as "حرس" on the basis that Persian language, for its part, has "just س". These acts could not and should not be regarded as serious because it has no scientific root but relies on unacceptable beliefs.
