# changes in Persian Map
below you can find a few notes about changes and the reason for changes.

## outline
the original map for Persian have some errors in it, some crucial and a
few in notes; I have append them based on official, wide accepted rules;
by **official** and **wide accepted** I mean they are rules that most 
scholars hold them as correct but still one could find junior academic 
individual who think differently. besides, there is a couple of controversies
on Persian alphabet, style of writing and spelling, such as for whether 
counting specific letters as independent letters; a few of them are occuring
in Arabic, as well, to name one, the problem with Hamza ء . furthermore, one 
another root for controversies or different styles is movements who trying to
distinguish themself from Arabic origin of letters and words; thinking in
that way, a minority write persian in *wrong* way deliberately and on purpose,
for example in social media it could be seen that, mostly, youngs write "حرص"
as "حرس" on the basis that Persian language, for its part, has "just س".
These acts could not and should not be regarded as serious because it has
no scientific root but relies on unacceptable beliefs.

## Hamza ء is in Persian Alphabet
in notes of original map it was stated that Hamza ء is not a Persian letter,
which is not correct and it is the first one. besides, even if it were not in
alphabet it is used as a character widely in writings. Thus, throwing away ends
up in chaos. the reference is BGN_Romanization_Guide_1964_persian_1958 but no
matter if it has a reference or not, it is wrong and should be corrected for many
reasons. 

the reason Hamza is a Persian letter comes from two origins:

1. modern (/new) Persian, i.e. after Islam advent has borrowed a lot of words
from Arabic; those words are not regarded as Arabic per se, but dealing with them
are like Persian words; thus you can find them in Persian dictionaries. The same
as Latin or to some extent Greek, absorbtion in European languages, accordingly
you can find "criterion" or "Chaos" in English dictionary, for example. so to
speak, those words have Hamza and absorbing, or borrowing, since Islam advent
letters borrowed. That history is dispensable and eliminate it is wrong and actually
nowadays, most scholars form different disciplines accept it. 

2. It employed even in Persian words with none-Arabic roots for different reasons:
sometimes likely for aesthetic reasons, sometimes for distinguish between different
spoken letter which has just on sign in writting, like "ی" whih is both a vowel and
a consonant; therefore, from many centuries ago to our times one could find the Farsi
word of "پایین" in previous style and also "پائین". 

3. more importantly, for the moment it is regarded as first letter of Persian alphabet
by Academy of Persian Language and Literature, that is responsible for unifying and
standardization of Persian writings. in any case, for any reason, if it would have been 
neglected, nust be denied. Such a act, especially based on speculations, or unvalid 
online resource could cause kinds of cultural damages. 

## The letter "آ" is not Persian exclusively
In the original map it was stated that, in addition to four letters گ چ پ ژ,
Alef Madda or "آ" is used just in Persian; as the map in its wholeness refered
to BGN_Romanization_Guide_1964_persian_1958, we could guess it was the origin, 
although the statement in the map was vague and in the referee, i.e.
BGN_Romanization_Guide_1964_persian_1958 I could not have find it.
to summarize it, "آ" is from Arabic origin and in Arabic there are words that
start with it, such as "آن" in Arabic wich means "second, moment". therefore, 
the letter is in both Persian and Arabic.

## Technical notes
I am not old enough to remember DOS era, but in 2000s, when I started using
computer, DOS OSs still had held their prestige and charizma over windows; thus,
I remember that time, untill 2005 approximately, DOS and its related applications
like, Zarnegar a word processor for Persian writing, was the first option. In many
cases, its reason was that the hardware just could handle DOS or operators were
accostumed to DOS. I even have worked with FreeDOS, thanks to Jim Hall.
the reason I told you this is that, this history played a crucial role in Persian
keyboard layout and Iranian people habits in writings on machines. these habits,
never abondoned. therefore, following notes has historical roots.


### Unicode of a certain letters
these letters that should be dealing with care as far as Persian is engaged are
letters: ک ی and their different shapes inside other letters. in the unicode,
especially UTF-8, we have: ی with the unicode `U+0649`, and ي with unicode as
`U+064A`; also, ک as `U+06A9` and ك `U+0643`. Iranian people just use the first
shape of those.
In Modern days, as Arabic countries and Iran and other countries with Persian, 
or Persian speakers, advanced their keyboard layout and unicodes separately and 
arbitrarily, or even due to spreading MS ISOs and keyboard layout, they have adopted  
different styles. in this way, Persian people, especially in Iran use "ی" in all cases,  
instead of the "ي" with two dots beneath it; and it is not in first layer of Persian 
keyboard (I mean the keys without switches through *shift* or *ctr* or *compose* keys). 
 In the other hand,in Arabic it is Alef Maghsura, which is totally different with
 the "ي".
